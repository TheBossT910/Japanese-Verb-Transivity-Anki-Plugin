# Japanese Verb Transivity Anki Plugin

An Anki plugin to parse cards and append the transivity of verbs as "Self-Move" (intransitive) or "Other-Move" (transitive). This was created as part of my Grade 12 Computer Engineering course final project, and thus also contains a presentation of Anki and my problem with the Core 2k/6k Deck and a daily development journal
